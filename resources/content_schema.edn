Always sanitize the HTML before embedding it directly to your application. The sanitizer needs to allow basic HTML tags, such as: `div`, `span`, `p`, `a`, `ul`, `li`, `table`, `tr`, `td`. For example, you can use [DOMPurify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify). CSS classes: * `issue-detail` - top level container for the detail of the issue * `callout-banners` - section of the `issue-detail` with callout banners * `callout-banner` - single callout banner, inside `callout-banners` * `callout-banner-info` - callout with important information (default) * `callout-banner-warning` - callout with a warning * `callout-banner-error` - callout informing about an error (most severe) * `issue-content` - section of the `issue-detail`, contains multiple `content-element` * `content-element` - content element such as a list, link or paragraph, inside `issue-content` * `root-causes` - unordered list with items describing root causes of the issue, inside `issue-content` * `root-causes-intro` - intro text before the `root-causes` list, inside `issue-content` * `segment` - section of the text, `span` inside paragraph * `segment-attribute` - section of the text that represents a product attribute, for example 'image\\_link' * `segment-literal` - section of the text that contains a special value, for example '0-1000 kg' * `segment-bold` - section of the text that should be rendered as bold * `segment-italic` - section of the text that should be rendered as italic * `tooltip` - used on paragraphs that should be rendered with a tooltip. A section of the text in such a paragraph will have a class `tooltip-text` and is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. If the style is not used, the `tooltip-text` section would be shown on a new line, after the main part of the text. * `tooltip-text` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. * `tooltip-icon` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that can be replaced with a tooltip icon, for example '?' or 'i'. By default, this section contains a `br` tag, that is separating the main text and the tooltip text when the style is not used. * `tooltip-style-question` - the tooltip shows helpful information, can use the '?' as an icon. * `tooltip-style-info` - the tooltip adds additional information fitting to the context, can use the 'i' as an icon. * `content-moderation` - marks the paragraph that explains how the issue was identified. * `new-element` - Present for new elements added to the pre-rendered content in the future. To make sure that a new content element does not break your style, you can hide everything with this class.",

To calculate price paid by the customer for a single line item including the discount: For each promotion, subtract the `LineItems[].adjustments[].priceAdjustment.value` amount from the `LineItems[].Price.value`. 2. To calculate price paid by the customer for a single line item including the discount in case of multiple quantity: For each promotion, divide the `LineItems[].adjustments[].priceAdjustment.value` by the quantity of products then subtract the resulting value from the `LineItems[].Product.Price.value` for each quantity item. Only 1 promotion can be applied to an offerId in a given order. To refund an item which had a promotion applied to it, make sure to refund the amount after first subtracting the promotion discount from the item price. More details about the program are here.",
