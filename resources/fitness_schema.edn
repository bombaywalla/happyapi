They can also expose derived data, created by transforming or merging other data sources. Multiple data sources can exist for the same data type. Every data point inserted into or read from this service has an associated data source. The data source contains enough information to uniquely identify its data, including the hardware device and the application that collected and/or transformed the data. It also holds useful metadata, such as the hardware and application versions, and the device type. Each data source produces a unique stream of data, with a unique identifier. Not all changes to data source affect the stream identifier, so that data collected by updated versions of the same application/device can still be considered to belong to the same data stream."},
 :Device {:description "Representation of an integrated device (such as a phone or a wearable) that can hold sensors. Each sensor is exposed as a data source. The main purpose of the device information contained in this class is to identify the hardware of a particular data source. This can be useful in different ways, including: - Distinguishing two similar sensors on different devices (the step counter on two nexus 5 phones, for instance) - Display the source of data to the user (by using the device make / model) - Treat data differently depending on sensor type (accelerometers on a watch may give different patterns than those on a phone) - Build different analysis models for each device/version.
