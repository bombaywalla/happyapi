  Body: 
  
  {:registrationId string,
   :feed {:feedType string,
          :courseRosterChangesInfo CourseRosterChangesInfo,
          :courseWorkChangesInfo CourseWorkChangesInfo},
   :cloudPubsubTopic {:topicName string},
   :expiryTime string}
  
  Creates a `Registration`, causing Classroom to start sending notifications from the provided `feed` to the destination provided in `cloudPubSubTopic`. Returns the created `Registration`. Currently, this will be the same as the argument, but with server-assigned fields such as `expiry_time` and `id` filled in. Note that any value specified for the `expiry_time` or `id` fields will be ignored. While Classroom may validate the `cloudPubSubTopic` and return errors on a best effort basis, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that it exists and that Classroom has permission to publish to it. This method may return the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if: * the authenticated user does not have permission to receive notifications from the requested field; or * the current user has not granted access to the current Cloud project with the appropriate scope for the requested feed. Note that domain-wide delegation of authority is not currently supported for this purpose. If the request has the appropriate scope, but no grant exists, a Request Errors is returned. * another access error is encountered. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if: * no `cloudPubsubTopic` is specified, or the specified `cloudPubsubTopic` is not valid; or * no `feed` is specified, or the specified `feed` is not valid. * `NOT_FOUND` if: * the specified `feed` cannot be located, or the requesting user does not have permission to determine whether or not it exists; or * the specified `cloudPubsubTopic` cannot be located, or Classroom has not been granted permission to publish to it."
